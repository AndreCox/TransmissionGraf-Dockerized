# TransmissionGraf Dockerized
Is a program which provides transmission-daemon info to InfluxDB  

The original script was made by [@Festeazy](https://github.com/Festeazy/TransmissionGraf) I have taken the script and updated it to run in a Docker Container as well as fixing a couple minor bugs that would cause a program crash.
