Ethics:
	the day before i shared this script, i thought about what the script does and how it can be used, part of me doesnt agree with sharing this script/idea.
even though the script is simple and anyone with scripting knowledge can craft, the idea has me confilicted.
This script tracks and maps torrent peers rough locations with their IP address and the item being shared, then going onto storing it.
In a sense, this connector allows alot of people to create their own personal "big brother" watching and surverying torrent downloads. 
	(Although, in reality there are many goverement and busniess entities doing this on a much larger scale)
that being said, i hope anyone using this idea is responible to others privacy. afterall many of these peers are your seeders.
i also hope this idea shows everyone the importance of a VPN Server while on the internet.
no one should ever know your real IP without it being for essential for the task you are trying to complete.


Bugs:
	i by no means am a coder but i couldnt find a connector anywhere online like this one so i tried to create one
there are bugs and issues in this script. if you find any flaws, put in a GitHub issue and ill work on correcting it. please try to be specific.
if there are any python coders out there reading this and think you could completely rehaul this script? Let me know.
I am not looking into running a github repository and am willing to accept any help. 
	if you are looking to be a contributer, please place some valid issues in first to prove you know your shit
